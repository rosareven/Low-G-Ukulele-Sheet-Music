When I'm mad, you're silver strong, and your eyes were agleam.

Now you're gray in the daytime and frayed and befallen, Christine.

They found you deep inside your den,

A haunt to your bones, and then

Escort you to court you

But you're firmly dying instead.

What has become of you now that you fled?

Betrayed in the serene where your earrings used to be.

And you're dancing like a brittle figurineâ€”

Some silhouette stuck in the sands of the town in between.

Get out of the night clubs and into the light.

The sea will surround you.

The sea, it surrounds you.

You see it surround you.

What has become of you now, Christine?
