[Dm]x4 [Gm]x2 [Dm]x2 [C]x1 [A#]x1 [Dm]x1 [A7]x1

[Dm]There you saw
A dirty one
Dirty one
Thought you'd caught
A curly one
Curly one
[Gm]Devil's flesh and bones
Catch him if you [Dm]can

Big boy blue
He ran away
Ran away
Find him on the
Bright of day
Bright of day
[Gm]Leave it on the line
Then he'll under[Dm]stand

{start_of_chorus}
When all is left to [C]you
No one coming [A#]through
Oh what's a girl to [Dm]do?
If the will de[C]mands
A sudden change of [A#]plans
You catch him if you [Dm]can [A7]
{end_of_chorus}

[Dm]Feel your heart freeze over
Feel your cold steel soldier
[Gm]Leave him out to dry
And find another [Dm]man

You try to bring it back
You don't
You try to find a snag
You won't
[Gm]We're all flesh and bones
So catch me if you [Dm]can

{start_of_chorus}
When all is left to [C]you

Oh what's a girl to [Dm]do?
If the will de[C]mands

You catch him if you [Dm]can [A7]
{end_of_chorus}

[Dm]Oooooh [Gm] [Dm] [D5] [Dm]
[Dm] [Gm] [A7]

[Dm]Try to bring it back
You don't
You try to find a snag
You won't
[Gm]We're all flesh and bones
So catch me if you [Dm]can
