[Dm] [Am]That's what the prophet said to me
[Dm] [Am]Child fits mother, so hold your baby tight
[Dm] [Am]That's what my future could see

[Dm] [Am]Fate fits karma, so use it
[Dm] [Am]That's what the wise man said to me
[Dm] [Am]Love fits virtue, so hold on to the light
[Dm] [Am]That's what our future will be

[Bb]Traveling down[F] this road[C]
Watching the [Dm]signs as I [Bb]go
I think I'll [F]follow the [C]sun
Isn't everyone just
[Bb]Traveling down[F] their own road[C]
Watching the [Dm]signs as they [Bb]go?
I think I'll [F]follow my [C]heart
It's a very good place to start

[Dm]Traveling down my own [G]road
[Dm]Watching the signs as I [G]go
[Dm]Traveling down my own [G]road

[Dm]Traveling, [G]traveling
[Dm]Watching the signs as I [G]go

[Dm] [Am]Hand fits giving, so do it
[Dm] [Am]That's what the Gospel said to me
[Dm] [Am]Life fits living, so let your judgments go
[Dm] [Am]That's how our future should be
